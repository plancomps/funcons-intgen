# funcons-intgen

## Installation

To install, a local installation of `uu-cco` version `>= 0.1.0.6` is required, as provided [here](https://github.com/ltbinsbe/uu-cco), taking the following steps:

1. download and unpack zip
2. enter folder `uu-cco` and run `cabal sdist`
3. within the `funcons-intgen` repository folder:  
`cabal get <UU-CCO/dist-newstyle/sdist/uu-cco-<VERSION>.tar.gz`  
where `<UU-CCO>` is the path to the `uu-cco` folder of the previous step and `<VERSION>` is the version of the package (`>= 0.1.0.6`)

After these steps, install the `cbsc` executable  (CBS compiler) by running:

```cabal install```
